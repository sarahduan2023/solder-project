Project Description

This is a simple hardware project for Hack Club's Solder submission. It features a blinking LED circuit built on a breadboard. The LED blinks on and off using a basic timing circuit (or manual switching, depending on the final setup). This project is designed to be beginner-friendly and demonstrates basic electronics concepts.

Bill of Materials (BOM)





Breadboard (1x, mini or standard size)



LED (1x, any color, e.g., red, 5mm)



Resistor (1x, 220-330 ohms, to limit current to the LED)



Jumper wires (2-4x, for connections)



Power source (e.g., 3-5V battery pack, USB power, or 9V battery with a voltage regulator)



(Optional) Push button or capacitor (for blinking effect, if not using a microcontroller)

Note: Parts can be sourced from local electronics stores or online (e.g., Amazon, AliExpress, or DigiKey).

Schematics, PCB, and 3D Views





Schematic: A simple hand-drawn or software-generated schematic will be added to the /schematics/ folder after circuit assembly.



PCB and 3D Views: This project uses a breadboard instead of a custom PCB, so no PCB design or Gerber files are included. A photo of the breadboard setup will be provided in the /images/ folder.

Additional Files





This project does not involve a custom PCB, so no Gerber or drill files are included.



All relevant files (schematics, photos, documentation) will be added to the /docs/, /images/, and /schematics/ folders after completing the circuit.

Project Status

Work in progress. Circuit assembly and documentation will be updated soon!
